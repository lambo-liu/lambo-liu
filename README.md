## Welcome &nbsp;👋

🌊&nbsp; I'm a 2nd year CS student at the University of Waterloo

🎸&nbsp; I like too many things to name - from [playing chess](https://www.chess.com/member/lamboliu) to [fantasy basketball](https://www.espn.com/fantasy/basketball/) to [discovering new music](https://open.spotify.com/user/tripledarts)

🌞&nbsp; But above all, I like creating software projects that make people smile!
