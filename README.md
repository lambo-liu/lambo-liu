## Welcome &nbsp;👋

🌊 I'm a 2rd year CS student at the University of Waterloo

🎸 I like too many things to name - from [chess](https://www.chess.com/member/lamboliu) to [fantasy basketball](https://www.espn.com/fantasy/basketball/) to [new music](https://open.spotify.com/user/tripledarts)

🌞 But above all, I like creating [cool projects](https://devpost.com/lamboliu) that make people smile!

📬 Feel free to reach out to me on my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lambert-liu/), I'd love to hear from you :)
