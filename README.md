## Welcome &nbsp;👋

🌊 I'm a 2rd year CS student at the University of Waterloo

🎸 I like too many things to name - from chess to fantasy basketball to music production

🌞 But above all, I like creating cool projects that make people smile!

📬 Feel free to reach out to me on my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lambert-liu/), I'd love to hear from you :)
